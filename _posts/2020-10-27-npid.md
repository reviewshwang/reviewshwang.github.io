# Unsupervised Feature Learning via Non-Parametric Instance Discrimination

## Introduction

### Motivation

- Above is tested with model trained with supervision for classification with cross-entropy loss. 

- Image from class *leopard* is rated much higher by class *jaguar* rather than by class *bookcase*.

- Typical discriminative learning method can automatically discover apparent similarity among semantic categories **without being explicitly guided to do so**.

- If we **learn to discriminate between individual instances** even without their labels, we may end up with a representation that captures apparent similarity *among instances*, just like how class-wise supervised learning still retains apparent similarity *among classes*.

## Approach

### Non-Parametric Softmax Classifier

Why no parametric softmax classifier?

- Parametric approach may not adapt to unseen classes or instances

- Don't need to compare & store gradients of parameters

- Learning general ability to discriminate the unlikes is what we want

Formulation

![Fig.2]({{site.url}}/assets/images/npid_2.png){: width="40%" height="40%"}

- **v**: encoded features from the memory bank

- \tau : temperature

Learnign objective is to maximize the joint probability

or equivantly to minimize the negative log-likelihood
